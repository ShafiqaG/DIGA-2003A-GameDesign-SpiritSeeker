  dialogueLines:
  - Oh hello dear child! It is the day of your special journey, do you need assistance?
  - Oh haha! You mean the Idara Amulet, unfortunately I seem to have misplaced the
    last one I had.
  - I seem to have misplaced the last one I had, but there are many artifacts around
    the village
  - If you can find the amulet, you may use it to pass through the gates.
  - A youthful spirit like yours should not be so forgetful.
  - Oh...see you later dear child.
  - Special artifacts reflect blue energy, try looking around the totem poles.
